#Project Title: alx_html_css

This Project is about learning the basic codes of css and also a little bit more of advanced css code.
The project has used technologies such as Hyper Text Markup Language and Casacading Style Sheets.
The project has two directories and the second directory has index.html file which can be run in browser using tools embedded in VS code one of which is Live server.

This project is a fully responsive, accessible web page built from scratch using pure HTML and CSS. No libraries or frameworks were used — just clean, semantic code following best practices in web development.
What I have learned
- Writing clean, semantic HTML
- Designing responsive layouts using media queries and flexbox/grid
- Structuring HTML for accessibility
- Applying consistent styling with reusable CSS classes
- Debugging layout issues across different screen sizes

To use it:
you can clone it using git clone then open .html files by use of a suitable browser.
