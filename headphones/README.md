This project is a fully responsive, accessible web page built from scratch using pure HTML and CSS. No libraries or frameworks were used — just clean, semantic code following best practices in web development.

What I have learned:

Writing clean, semantic HTML
Designing responsive layouts using media queries and flexbox/grid
Structuring HTML for accessibility
Applying consistent styling with reusable CSS classes
Debugging layout issues across different screen sizes
To use it: you can clone it using git clone then open .html files by use of a suitable browser.
